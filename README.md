# Fraction Calculator

A Python 3.7 project for command line to perform basic math operations with fraction, baic operation are +, -, * and /

This is how it works:

* Fraction format: whole_numerator/denominator. e.g. "3_1/4"
* Operation allowd: + (Add), - (Subtract), * (Multiplication), / (Division).
* Sinle line input: The full operation needs to be entered in a sigle line. e.g. "1/4 + 1_3/5"
* Operands and operators shall be separated by one or more spaces.
* Improper fractions and whole numbers are also allowed as operands. e.g. "11/4" or "5"
* Multiple operands and operators are allowed. e.g. "3/7 + 8_1/2 - 5/6 * 11/3"
* At least two operands and one operator are needed to have a valid operation.
* Negative numbers are allowed. e.g. "-6_3/4" or "-7" or "-4/5"
* The result will also be represented as a fraction, unless it is whole.
